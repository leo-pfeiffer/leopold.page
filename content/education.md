### MSc Data-Intensive Analysis
|  |  |
| :------- | :------- |
| **University of St Andrews**<br>Sep 2020 - Sep 2021<br>St Andrews, UK<br>Current GPA: 18.5 ([~ 4.0 US](https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/administration/academicdatateam/assessmentandawards/undergraduateinformation/)) | ![](images/st-andrews.png) |
<br>

I studied a combination of applied statistics and computer science modules. The highlights were:

* Object-Oriented Modelling and Design: Several Java programming projects with a focus on OOP (see [Projects](/projects))

* Applied Statistical Modelling using GLMs: Extensive course with many applied practicals on Generalised Linear Models

* Advanced Data Analysis: Broad range of advanced statistical models, mostly GAMs, GEEs and GLMMs

* Masters Programming Project: Worked on different (group) projects using JavaScript (incl. NodeJS, Vue) and MongoDB (see [Projects](/projects))

| **University of Augsburg**<br>Oct 2017 - Jun 2020<br>Augsburg, Germany<br>GPA: 1,38 ([~ 3.7 US](https://www.oecd.org/careers/young-associate-programme/yap_gpa_guidelines.pdf)) | ![](images/augsburg.png) |
<br>
I took a range of management modules until I realised my passion for code. From the third semester on, I started focusing on data analysis as well as simulation and optimisation in a logistics context. Some of the most interesting parts of my degree include:
* Data Analysis with R: R programming course that sparked my interest in applied data analysis.

* PageRank project seminar: Implemented the famous Google PageRank algorithm in Python and explored the mathematical background.

* [AI in Strategic Games project seminar](https://github.com/leo-pfeiffer/AI4Connect4): Developed two AI implementations (MCTS and Alpha-Beta Pruning) for the game connect four in Python and wrote a small web application for the game.

* [Learning from Nature - Using Genetic Algorithms for Inventory Optimisation](https://github.com/leo-pfeiffer/bachelorthesis_geneticalgo): My bachelor thesis in which I developed a serial supply chain model in Python and implemented a Genetic Algorithm to optimise the inventory policies of the actors in the supply chain.

### Visiting Student (Maths, Financial Econ & Management)

I fell in love with St Andrews and Scotland during my semester abroad. In addition to modules on Corporate Finance and Financial Economics: Asset Pricing, I enjoyed two modules of the School of Mathematics and Statistics: Analysis and Combinatorics & Probability. Both were great fun and were certainly a good preparation for the more maths-heavy parts of my first master's degree.

During year 10 of highschool I got to spend three months living with an amazing host family near Melbourne, Australia. I still (and always will) consider this some of the best three months of my life!
